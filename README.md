My first repository


# Hi there, I'm Maj Omor 👋

I'm a passionate gamer who loves playing **Mobile Legends** and a big fan of **basketball**. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me strategizing in the jungle or shooting hoops on the court. I believe both games and sports teach valuable lessons in teamwork, strategy, and perseverance—principles I try to apply in my work as well.

Feel free to browse through my repositories, and let's connect if you share similar interests or want to collaborate on a project!

- 🎮 Favorite game: Mobile Legends
